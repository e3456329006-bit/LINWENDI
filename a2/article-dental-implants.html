    <h2>Understanding Dental Implants</h2>

    <p>
        Dental implants are a long-lasting and reliable solution for replacing missing teeth. They look and function 
        like natural teeth, making them an excellent choice for individuals who want to restore their smile and 
        maintain strong oral health.
    </p>

    <h3>What Are Dental Implants?</h3>
    <p>
        A dental implant consists of a titanium post that is surgically placed into the jawbone. Once the bone heals 
        around the post, a crown is attached, creating a replacement tooth that blends seamlessly with the rest of 
        your smile.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits of Implants</h3>
    <p>
        Implants help preserve jawbone strength, prevent shifting of nearby teeth, and offer improved comfort when 
        compared to traditional dentures. They also provide greater bite stability and durability.
    </p>

    <h3>Who Can Receive Implants?</h3>
    <p>
        Individuals with healthy gums and sufficient bone density are typically good candidates. A consultation with 
        a dentist can help determine whether implants are the right choice for your needs.
