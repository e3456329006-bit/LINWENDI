<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Digital X-Rays:</strong>
        Our state-of-the-art digital X-ray system provides high-resolution images with significantly less radiation
        exposure compared to traditional X-rays. This technology allows for quicker and more accurate diagnoses,
        ensuring that we can address dental issues promptly and effectively.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Intraoral Cameras:</strong>
        Our intraoral cameras offer a detailed view of your mouth, allowing us to capture high-quality images of your
        teeth and gums. This technology enhances our ability to detect and diagnose dental problems early, and it
        also helps us to better explain treatment options to our patients.

    <li>
        <strong>Laser Dentistry:</strong>
        We have incorporated advanced laser technology into our practice, which allows for minimally invasive
        procedures with reduced pain and faster healing times. Laser dentistry is used for a variety of treatments,
        including gum disease therapy, cavity detection, and teeth whitening.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>CAD/CAM Technology:</strong>
        Our CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing) system enables us to create precise
        and custom dental restorations, such as crowns, bridges, and veneers, in a single visit. This technology
        ensures a perfect fit and natural appearance, providing our patients with durable and aesthetically pleasing
        results.
