    <h2>Tips for Maintaining Oral Hygiene</h2>

    <p>
        Good oral hygiene plays an essential role in keeping your teeth and gums healthy throughout your life. 
        Simple daily habits, when practiced consistently, can prevent many common dental issues such as cavities, 
        gum inflammation, and bad breath.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Brush Properly Twice a Day</h3>
    <p>
        Brushing your teeth for at least two minutes each morning and night helps remove plaque and food 
        particles. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, and make sure to reach all tooth surfaces.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Don’t Skip Flossing</h3>
    <p>
        Flossing removes plaque from areas your toothbrush cannot reach, especially between teeth and under 
        the gumline. Daily flossing reduces the risk of gum disease and improves overall oral health.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Limit Sugary Foods</h3>
    <p>
        Frequent snacking on sugary foods and drinks feeds harmful bacteria in your mouth. Reducing sugar intake 
        helps protect your enamel and prevents cavities.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Visit Your Dentist Regularly</h3>
    <p>
        Routine dental check-ups allow early detection of potential issues and ensure your teeth stay clean and 
        healthy. Regular professional cleanings also support better long-term oral health.
